A high-performance, responsive personal portfolio website featuring a modern **Glassmorphism** design aesthetic. This project showcases my skills in Web Development, Content Creation, and Backend Systems.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Glassmorphism UI**: Modern, translucent card designs with background blurring effects.
* **Smart Greeting System**: Automatically detects the time of day to greet users (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) and displays the current date dynamically.
* **Interactive Animations**:
    * **Typing Effect**: A terminal-style typing animation for the mission statement.
    * **Live Counter**: Statistics that count up smoothly when the user scrolls to them.
    * **Floating Orbs**: Ambient background animations using pure CSS.
* **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: Semantic structure and layout.
* **CSS3**: Custom variables, Flexbox/Grid, Animations, and Media Queries.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: DOM manipulation, `IntersectionObserver` for scroll effects, and Date logic.
* **Font Awesome**: Icons for social media and UI elements.
* **Google Fonts**: Typography (Outfit font family).
